OVERVIEW
Project:          Teachable Peer Learner
PI:               Noboru Matsuda
Data Provider:    Steve Ritter
Curriculum:       SimStudent Study
Dates:            Apr 22, 2010 - May 28, 2010
Area/Subject:     Math/Algebra
Tutor:            Cognitive Tutor 2009
Description:      Theory Wiki:
                  http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Application_of_SimStudent_for_Error_Analysis

                  Control condition using Cognitive Tutor for the Learning by Teaching
                  baseline study with SimStudent.
                  Conditions are named xyz - x:pre-Test Version (A, B, or C), y:post-Test
                  version (A, B, or C), z: intervention condition (SS for SimStudent or CL
                  for CogTutor)

                  Outcome - BUG is common, expected misconception or error, ERROR is other,
                  unexpected error.
                  Steps for scratchpad (multiply fractions) - pm-r-num-node (multiply
                  numerators), pm-r-den-node (multiply denominators) and FinalAnswer
                  Selection - left is left hand side of equation, right is right hand side,
                  strategic is transformation or other planning parts.
                  Action for simplification steps:
                  clt = Combine Like Terms
                  mt = Perform Multiplication (ie Multiply Terms)
                  rf = Simplify Fractions (ie Reduce Fractions)
                  rds = Simplify Signs
                  distribute = Distribute (obviously)
                  ivm = Invert and Multiply

                  Feedback classification: BUG is JIT pop-up for common misconception, HINT
                  is requested hint, AUTOHELP is unrequested hint after repeated mistakes.

                  4/11/2011: Loaded via DB Merge. This data was reloaded after Tristan fixed
                  the munger.  The munger is now putting left, right, etc. in the name of the
                  steps for equation solving problems.  This dataset replaces AlgebraI 2010
